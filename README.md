# Siope Data Retriever

##What is this
This is a Python Script that downloads data from [Siope] (https://www.siope.it) and populates **siope** db in MongoDB.

**Siope** (Sistema Informativo delle OPerazioni degli Enti pubblici) is a system of electronic detection of collections and payments made by the cashiers of italian public services.

##How it works

There are three automatic steps:

1. Data retrieval (download and unzip files)
2. Aggregation of csv files _ENTRATE*.csv_ and _USCITE*.csv_ (where * is the year) into *ENTRATE.CSV* and *USCITE.CSV*
3. Three steps in MongoDB:
 	1. Each row of each csv file is insert as document in the collection corresponding (examples of collection: *csv_entrate*, *csv_enti* and so on)
  	2. Creating _mdb\__\*<name_collection>. These are mongo style collections, in particular *mdb_entrate* and *mdb_uscite* where each income and outcome has more information about it (ente, for example). The other important collection is *mdb_enti*.
  	3. Creating two "time series collections": *mdb_entrate_mensili* and *mdb_uscite_mensili* where you can find income and outcome grouped by year/period/cod_ente in an array of subdocuments.
  	
You can run this script every Friday to update data. 

NB: 3.1 and 3.3 drop collections and recreate them. 3.2 is an incremental update.
  
##Instructions

###Script use

    usage: main.py [-h] [--download=True] [--download=False] [--host HOST]
               [--port PORT]

    Store Siope.it data in MongoDB

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --download=True   (DEFAULT) Download data from Siope.it
      --download=False  Not download data from Siope.it, you must just have them
                        in csvfiles directory
      --host HOST       (DEFAULT: localhost) Hostname or IP address where mongod
                        is running
      --port PORT       (DEFAULT: 27017) Port used by mongod process

The script may take several minutes.
** You can use pypy to speed up the process! ** (~50% faster)

###Queries

*queries.js* contains some sample queries. To use this:

    > mongo
    > use siope
    > load('queries.js')
    > queries.<function_name>.([year])
    
 Example of [Aggregation Framework] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/):
 	
 	> queries.entratePerEnte(2015)
	function (){
			return db.mdb_entrate_mensili.aggregate([
				{$match : {'ANNO' : anno}},
				{$unwind : '$IMPORTI'},
				{$group : {_id : {'ENTE' : '$DESCR_ENTE'}, 'Totale': {$sum : '$IMPORTI.IMPORTO'}}},
				{$sort : {'Totale' : -1}},
				{$project : {'Totale' : { $divide : ['$Totale', 100000000000]}}},
				{$project : {'Totale Miliardi â‚¬' : {$divide:[{$subtract:[{$multiply:['$Totale',100]},
				{$mod:[{$multiply:['$Totale',100]}, 1]}]},100]}}}
				]); 
		}

If you want to store some aggregated result in a collection you can use Map-Reduce.

Example of [Map-Reduce] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/map-reduce/):

	> queries.uscitePerEnteMR(2015)
	function (){
                        return db.mdb_uscite_mensili.mapReduce(
                                function() {
                                        lista = [];
                                        this.IMPORTI.forEach(function(x){
                                                lista.push(x['IMPORTO']/100000000000);
                                        });
                                        emit(this.DESCR_ENTE, Math.round(Array.sum(lista)*100)/100);
                                },
                                function(key, values){return Array.sum(values)},
                                {
                                        query: { ANNO: anno },
                                        out: "uscitePerEnteMR"
                                }
                        )
                }
And then:

	> db.uscitePerEnteMR.find()

or

	> db.uscitePerEnteMR.find().sort({value:-1})

...or whatever you want to do. 

###Indexes
You can use *ensureIndexes.js* file to ensure new indexes on collections.
Open and modify it as you want.

To use this, run:

	mongo < ensureIndexes.js
    
##Dependencies and compatibility

You may need to install the module **pymongo**.

Link: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>

You can install it with pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>

Test cases:

- Python 2 (Mac OS X, Ubuntu)
- Python 3 (Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Windows 10)
